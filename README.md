In this project, I need to implement the decision tree from scratch for different dataset.

## Data Preprocessing
I clean the outlier in the dataset and use **knn** imputation to fill up the missing values.

## First version
I choose the **infomation gain** (IG) as the feature to sperate the dataset into two leaves in nodes. In addition, I use pre-prunning to avoid the tree be overfitting.

## Second version
In this version, I implement the boosting skill using the algorithm of **Adaboost.m1**, which is the modified version of Adaboost for the multi-class classification task.
